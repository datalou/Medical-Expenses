# Patient Expenses Prediction using Linear Regression and Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to predict patient medical expenses using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, with Python. 
The dataset used for this project includes various patient features like age, BMI, sex, and more, which are used to estimate the overall medical costs.

## Overview

In healthcare, estimating the medical expenses for patients is crucial for budgeting and planning. 
By using machine learning models, we can analyze various features of patients and predict their expenses. 
This project focuses on implementing a linear regression model to predict the charges incurred by patients.

The steps involved include:
1. Data loading and cleaning.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature selection.
3. Building a linear regression model.
4. Evaluating the model's performance.

## Dataset

I use **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**, which contains information like:
- Age: Age of the patient.
- Sex: Gender of the patient.
- BMI: Body mass index.
- Children: Number of children/dependents.
- Smoker: Whether the patient is a smoker.
- Region: The region where the patient resides.
- Charges: Medical expenses incurred.

## Requirements

To run the code, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Model Explanation

I use **Linear Regression**, which models the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target - patient expenses). 
The idea is to fit a straight line through the data that minimizes the residual sum of squares between the actual and predicted expenses.

### Workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
    - Clean missing or invalid data.
    - One-hot encode categorical features (e.g., sex, smoker, region).
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**
    - Train a linear regression model using the training dataset.
    - Use scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class to build the model.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.

## Results

After training and evaluating the model, we achieve the following results:
- **R² Score:** X.XX
- **Mean Absolute Error:** XXXX
- **Mean Squared Error:** XXXX

These results indicate the accuracy of our linear regression model in predicting patient medical expenses.
